I’m an Electrical Engineering student. I want to invent something, either in the field of biomechanics or environmental engineering, and patent it. I want to improve my C++, CAD, Altium, and other technical skills. As an athlete on UCLA’s Club Triathlon team, I want to reach athletic goals I’ve set for myself, such as a double century, a half marathon, and a top 15 sprint triathlon finish. I want to improve my guitar skills & my music theory comprehension, and record an EP onto Spotify/Apple Music with my friends Evan and Jake. I want to read the books on my list, go out, go on dates, and spend time forming lifelong friendships. At some point in college I’d like to start another venture or company like STEAM Team, and lead a team and a technical project to fruition and commercial application.

If the things I spend time on do not directly make me happy, I should go and do something I actually want to. Like these.
