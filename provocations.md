# Provocations

Hoping to incite creativity in myself and in others. These are my provocations, my projects-to-be, and the ideas that haven't quite made it to the table yet. Idea inspired by [periodfutures.org](https://www.periodfutures.org/).

 <h2> Clip Pedal Snap-On Platforms in CAD </h2>

I commute on my race bike sometimes, which have eggbeater style clip pedals on them. These pedals can't be used with sneakers, which is a real pain. I want to CAD some snap-on flat platforms that will fit around the thin metal wiring of these pedals, to make the process of shifting between commutes and rides a bit easier.

<h2> Topography: Mapping the Volume of a Mountain </h2>

Model topographic change with basic revolution by integration concepts, starting with a mountain's elevation profile of a mountain. Develop a program which extracts data on points of elevation, taken at an interval, of a well traveled mountain like Shasta, and fits a curve to estimate the shapes of individual portions of the mountain, traveling down the y-axis and estimating curves to fit (assume y-axis to run vertically through mountain). Materials used: [Python API from Blender](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html) to build virtually estimated models of topographic growth and change.

## Making Research More Accessible

The above Topography project is a precursor idea to a larger hobby-project I’ve envisioned, where I can take research papers and turn them into more accessible, online labs modeled like the [PBS Nova series](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/labs/). Take well-known research papers, grind the science and specifics down to an online interactive laboratory which younger students can access. I wonder how science and math education would look different if students themselves could interact with real-world instances of recent scientific advancements.

## The Mathematics of Sitcom Laugh Tracks

Sitcom laugh-tracks: the laugh tracks in sitcoms and shows (such as Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond, and even Disney shows) seem almost rhythmic - perhaps intentionally so, in order to keep the audience engaged. The ulterior motive of keeping an audience is likely correlated with how often a laugh track plays, so I wonder if it’s possible to develop a mathematical model of the laughter in the episodes of these shows, which can predict when the next laugh track will play.

## The Mathematics of a Book

Paperback to PDF conversions of books: there is usually a difference in page number between the two formats. I wonder which variables account most for this. Off the top of my head, I can think of several factors which might apply to the page difference: horizontal margin width, vertical margin height, presence or absence of extra writings such as forward and prefaces, font size, average line count, spacing between characters, and the height of white space at end of a chapter & beginning of a chapter. Could I write an equation equating these things?

## STEAM Team: Communication Platform for Schools and Clubs

This is a connective aspect I'd like to build into [STEAM Team](steamteamorg.weebly.com) (see my Projects page or resume for more info) to bring schools and educators together. I imagine the format to be a secure platform integrated in our site, for elementary school faculty and high school club leaders running STEAM programs to connect with one another and start up STEAM classes individually. Currently, the process of outreach is decentralized and highly individualized, which can lead to missed opportunities and disorganized communication.

## UCLA Technology Review

I really like what the folks over at the [Brown Technology Review](https://medium.com/brown-technology-review) are doing. I would love to start a technology review publication at my own school, tapping into and analyzing the ethical, political, and social aspects of technological innovation either in the greater LA area, the country, or the world as a whole.

## GPX File Code

I recently thru-hiked the Tahoe Rim Trail, and two of my friends tracked each day's progress on their Garmins. I now have at least ten different files with a range of 8-12 hours of data each, so I'd like to write a python program to put all of these routes together for me into one large thru-hike. I'm working in VS Code and [Router](https://readmeansrun.com/router/).
