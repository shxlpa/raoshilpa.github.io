[[Shilpa Rao's Resume, updated Oct 2021]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lPfwIf3odX_3TeM4yObS7G1fhmhF1aG8/view?usp=sharing)

I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in CS at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I'm interested in computer engineering, automation, reinforcement learning, environmental engineering, history, and english.


## Current:
- Working on [a project to rewrite The Good Place finale](https://github.com/raoshilpa/rewritingGoodPlaceFinale), because it sucked and we want a better one.
- [Writing a GUI to collect Pressure Transducer and Load Cell data](https://github.com/UCLA-Rocket-Project/prometheus-groundsys-2021) for the Hybrid Propulsion Rocket we're building at [UCLA Rocket Project](http://rocketproject.seas.ucla.edu).
- Project lead for the [Under The Hood](http://artsci.ucla.edu/under-the-hood) video series & employee at the [UCLA ArtSci Center](http://artsci.ucla.edu/).
- Co-founder and current board member of [STEAM Team](http://steamfs.org/).


## Skills: 

Proficient in C++, Python, Fusion 360. Learning robot operating system (ROS).


## Misc:

I recently started an interview series with my Nani to learn more about her life; I'll post it on youtube in the coming weeks. When I'm back in the Bay Area, I coach for my old XCMTB team, [Black Mountain Composite](http://www.blackmountainmtb.org/).
I'm into everything outdoors, coming from a background where I raced cross country mountain bikes in high school. I started backpacking around the same time and my two biggest non-academic/non-service oriented goals are to improve at fingerstyle guitar and become a better alpine climber.
I did Shasta and it was way too fun, so I'm working on taking some (avalanche, wilderness first aid) classes and maybe hopefully I can land a side-gig as a mountain guide one day.
I write about my projects, thoughts, and technical tips at [ShilpaOnTheInternet](https://shilpaontheinternet.wordpress.com).
