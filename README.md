# It's nice to meet you!

I'm Shilpa. I'm a freshman at UCLA, studying various things. 

My personal writing portfolio includes a [literary research paper on Jhumpa Lahiri's work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kcqNL44ae6O0nsqL5KTu3EWbf3StlrCORGjADGM4yYM/edit?usp=sharing), an [economic and technological essay on Covid-19 inspired innovation](https://medium.com/@shilpa.padiki.rao/covid-19-emerging-technologies-and-their-economic-implications-d46fa8c0f669), and a [personal blog](https://shilpaontheinternet.wordpress.com).

I spent 3 years as the founder of [STEAM Team](http://steamteamorg.weebly.com/), developing a STEM+Art education curriculum with my team and starting up interdisciplinary programs in underfunded elementary schools. I've also been a research intern for [Tutree](http://v2.tutree.com/), an intern for [Portworx](https://portworx.com/), and a sponsorship/outreach team member raising funds for [Los Altos Hacks](https://www.losaltoshacks.com/).

I'm familiar with Jira, Salesforce, and Google Analytics. Other skills include: data analysis, competitive mountain biking, and leading small projects/teams to become larger projects with hundreds of people reached.
My hobbies include cycling/backpacking, applying for things I'm not qualified for (yet), writing, and fixing old and crappy things with duct tape and some screws.
