I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in CS at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I'm interested in automation, biomechanics, environmental engineering, and history. I'm on the triathlon team at UCLA and [write](https://shilpaontheinternet.wordpress.com) about my outdoorsy adventures in my free time.


## Current:

- Co-founder and current board member of [STEAM Team](http://steamfs.org/).


## Past:

- [Wrote a GUI to collect Pressure Transducer and Load Cell data](https://github.com/UCLA-Rocket-Project/prometheus-groundsys-2021) for the Hybrid Propulsion Rocket [UCLA Rocket Project](http://rocketproject.seas.ucla.edu) launched in June 2021.
- Project lead from Oct 2020-June 2021 for the [Under The Hood](http://artsci.ucla.edu/under-the-hood) video series & employee at the [UCLA ArtSci Center](http://artsci.ucla.edu/).


## Skills: 

C++, Python, Matlab, PID Control, sensor fusion, Fusion 360.


## Misc:

I recently started an interview series with my Nani to learn more about her life; I'll post it on youtube in the coming weeks. When I'm back in the Bay Area, I coach for my old XCMTB team, [Black Mountain Composite](http://www.blackmountainmtb.org/).
I'm into everything outdoors, coming from a background where I raced cross country mountain bikes in high school. I joined the triathlon team in college, where I get to apply my old competitive swim chops, as well as my recreational running skills and my cycling skills. I started backpacking a few years ago, and my two biggest non-career oriented goals are to improve at fingerstyle guitar and become a better athlete & alpine climber.
I did Shasta and it was way too fun, so I'm working on taking some (avalanche, wilderness first aid) classes and maybe hopefully I can land a side-gig as a mountain guide one day.
I write about my projects, thoughts, and technical tips at [ShilpaOnTheInternet](https://shilpaontheinternet.wordpress.com).


## My current reading list is:

1. Noise

2. The Book of Form and Emptiness

3. Confessions of a Mask

4. Life of Pi
